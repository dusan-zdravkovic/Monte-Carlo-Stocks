# ðŸ“ˆ Monte Carlo Stock Price Simulation Using Twelve Data API

This project uses real historical stock data to simulate possible future prices using Monte Carlo methods. The goal is to visualize price uncertainty and understand how well such simulations could have predicted actual prices.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- **Twelve Data API:** For fetching real historical daily stock prices.
- **Python:** Used for all simulation, analysis, and plotting.
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib:** Key Python libraries used.
- **VSCode + Jupyter Notebooks:** For development, iteration, and visualization.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

- Simulate 1-year future stock prices for 8 major stocks based on 2020â€“2021 data.
- Compare the simulation results to actual prices from March 1, 2022.
- Visualize all simulations and final predicted price distributions.
- Analyze accuracy and prediction error.
